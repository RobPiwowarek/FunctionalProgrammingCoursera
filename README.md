Martin Odersky's Functional Programming in Scala Course on Coursera

Week 1:  
  
Exercise 1
-----------------------------
Do this exercise by implementing the pascal function in Main.scala, which takes a column c and a row r, counting from 0 and returns the number at that spot in the triangle. For example, pascal(0,2)=1,pascal(1,2)=2 and pascal(1,3)=3.

Exercise 2
-----------------------------
Write a recursive function which verifies the balancing of parentheses in a string, which we represent as a List[Char] not a String. For example, the function should return true for the following strings:

(if (zero? x) max (/ 1 x))
I told him (that it’s not (yet) done). (But he wasn’t listening)
The function should return false for the following strings:

:-)
())(

Exercise 3
-----------------------------
Write a recursive function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
